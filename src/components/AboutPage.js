                                I am a data-focused software engineer with a background in government,
                                finance, and consulting. I have nearly 10 years of experience wrangling
                                and gleaning insights from large, complex datasets. I have experience with
                                data visualization, web development, and data science.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I recently completed a Masters in Computer Science at Cornell Tech,
                                focused on the intersection of data and engineering. I studied Algorithms,
                                Machine Learning, Data Science, and Distributed. Iâ€™m experienced working
                                with Python, JavaScript, React, HTML, SQL, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy,
                                Spark, Tableau, and more.
